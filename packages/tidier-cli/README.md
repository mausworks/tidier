Tidier helps you keep your projects & workspaces clean automatically renaming files to keep a consistent format

## CLI features

The tidier CLI currently supports two modes, "checking" and "writing", it is very much like other formatters or linters.
Running `tidier -c` will check for problems in the project, and running `tidier -w` will write fixes to the project.
